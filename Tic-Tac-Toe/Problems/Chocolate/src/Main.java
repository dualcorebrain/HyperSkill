/*
Imagine a chocolate bar. Remember how it is usually split into smaller bits by a special grid?

Now think of chocolate as an N x M rectangle divided into little segments: N segments in length and M in width. Find out whether it is possible to break off exactly K segments from the chocolate with a single straight line: vertical or horizontal.

Each segment is 1x1.

Input data format

The program gets an input of three integers: N, M, K.

Output data format

The program must output one of the two words: YES or NO.

Hint
